## DrumPad Loading State Analysis

The `isLoaded` state in the DrumPad component is redundant and can be safely removed because:

1. The DrumMachine component maintains a `samplersLoaded` state that only becomes true when all 8 samplers and 4 kits are loaded
2. The DrumMachine component renders a loading message (`Loading samplers...`) until `samplersLoaded` is true
3. DrumPad components are only rendered after this check, meaning they will always receive fully loaded samplers
4. The `sampler.loaded` property is therefore guaranteed to be true by the time any DrumPad component mounts

### Recommended Changes
- Remove the `isLoaded` state from DrumPad
- Remove the `useEffect` that monitors the loaded state
- Remove the `disabled` prop from the button
- Remove loading text from the button label
- Remove the `isLoaded` checks from `handlePressPad` and `handleReleasePad`
